            <h1>How to lose fat?</h1>
            <h2>Start strength training</h2>
            <p>Strength training may not only help decrease your body fat levels but also increase resting energy
                expenditure and target belly fat.</p>
            <h2>Follow a high protein diet</h2>
            <p>Eating more protein may be associated with a lower risk of belly fat. Plus, it may decrease appetite,
                lower calorie intake, and preserve muscle mass.</p>
            <h2>Fill up on fiber</h2>
            <p>Upping your fiber intake by consuming foods like fresh fruits, veggies, and legumes may boost fat loss,
                feelings of fullness, and weight loss.</p>
            <h2>Increase your cardio</h2>
            <p>Studies show that the more aerobic exercise people get, the more body fat they tend to lose. Cardio may
                also help reduce waist circumference and increase muscle mass.</p>

        <h1>How to gain muscles</h1>
        <h2>Lift weights</h2>
        <p>To build muscle, you need to place enough stress on your muscles to force them to adapt; and lifting weights
            is the perfect solution. According to research, resistance training places your muscles under enough tension
            and plays a crucial role in muscle development.
            While resistance training can be done with your bodyweight, it’s best completed with weights – especially if
            your goal is to build muscle.</p>
        <h2>Fuel on protein</h2>
        <p>Start reading food labels to get a sense of how many calories you’re already eating. Then, add 500 to that
            number and start eating that many calories every day. Aim to take in about 1g of protein per pound of
            bodyweight each day, ‘cus you’re probably not eating enough protein.</p>
        <h2>Limit cardio</h2>
        <p>Ever thought about how much cardio can you do without losing muscle? Stick by this: You can do up to two days
            of light jogging on the treadmill, but keep it to around 30 minutes per session. To lose fat while sparing
            muscle, you’d do even better to perform sprint intervals; for instance, running all-out for a minute, then
            backing off to a light jog for two minutes. Do this for 30 minutes, three times a week.</p>
        <h2>Eat regularly</h2>
        <p>You should wolf down five to six small meals a day, especially if you’re a hardgainer. As long as
            good-quality fuel keeps coming into your body—particularly protein and carbs—you’ll have the calories to
            build muscle and the metabolism boost to lose fat.</p>
        <h2>Rest &#038; recover</h2>
        <p>The ideal amount of sleep is seven to eight hours per night. You can let loose a night or two each week. But
            when you do, try to make up for it ASAP. Train no more than four times a week. As for your job, do whatever
            you can to avoid excess stress; chronic nervousness elevates cortisol, a hormone that makes your body store
            fat and burn muscle.</p>
